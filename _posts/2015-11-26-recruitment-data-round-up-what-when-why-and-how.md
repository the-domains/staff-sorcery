description: "'Recruitment Data: What, When, Why And How', was the very last In-house Recruitment Network breakfast of 2015, and it was an absolute pleasure to share it with event partners, Broadbean Technology. The final breakfast event of the year united just over 30 in-house recruitment professionals, all of whom were keen for an education on the world of recruitment data and how to take advantage of it."
