description: "Attracting new talent is a piece of cake if your company has a sterling reputation in the industry and is associated with driving innovation or hosting industry leaders. But what happens if that's not the case? Company reputation plays a key role in recruitment - even in tough economy, many unemployed people would never consider working for someone with a bad reputation."
